# Project Context

This file is auto-generated by Puffin to provide context to Claude Code.

## Project Overview

**Project:** puffin

Puffin is an Electron-based GUI application that serves as a **management layer** on top of the Claude Code CLI (3CLI). Its primary purpose is to:

1. **Track and organize** 3CLI outputs and conversations
2. **Provide context** to 3CLI through project configuration and history
3. **Visualize** the development process (prompts, responses, branches)
4. **Communicate UI designs** via the GUI designer

**Important**: 3CLI remains in control of building the project. Puffin is an orchestration and tracking tool, not a replacement for the CLI's capabilities.

## File Access Restrictions

**IMPORTANT: You must ONLY access files within this project directory.**

You are NOT allowed to:
- Read, write, or modify files outside this project
- Access parent directories or sibling projects
- Reference or use files from other projects on the system
- Execute commands that affect files outside the project root

All file operations must be scoped to this project directory and its subdirectories.
