# Project Context

This file is auto-generated by Puffin to provide context to Claude Code.

## Project Overview

**Project:** puffin

Puffin is an Electron-based GUI application that serves as a **management layer** on top of the Claude Code CLI (3CLI). Its primary purpose is to:

1. **Track and organize** 3CLI outputs and conversations
2. **Provide context** to 3CLI through project configuration and history
3. **Visualize** the development process (prompts, responses, branches)
4. **Communicate UI designs** via the GUI designer

**Important**: 3CLI remains in control of building the project. Puffin is an orchestration and tracking tool, not a replacement for the CLI's capabilities.

## File Access Restrictions

**IMPORTANT: You must ONLY access files within this project directory.**

You are NOT allowed to:
- Read, write, or modify files outside this project
- Access parent directories or sibling projects
- Reference or use files from other projects on the system
- Execute commands that affect files outside the project root

All file operations must be scoped to this project directory and its subdirectories.

## Completed User Stories

The following stories have been completed and are available for reference:

- **Drag and Drop Post-it Notes Between Days**: As a developer, I want to drag and drop post-it notes from one calendar day to another so that I can quickly reschedule or reorganize my notes without manual editing
- **Copy and Paste Post-it Notes Between Days**: As a developer, I want to copy and paste post-it notes so that I can duplicate notes across multiple days without retyping the content

- **Fix Path Traversal Vulnerability in Image Delete**: As a developer, I want the deleteImage method to validate file paths so that malicious actors cannot delete arbitrary files outside the temp directory
- **Add Maximum File Size Validation for Image Upload**: As a developer, I want image uploads to enforce a maximum file size so that disk space cannot be exhausted by oversized files

- **Add Debouncing to Project Form Input Handler**: As a developer, I want input changes in the project form to be debounced so that rapid typing doesn't cause excessive updates
- **Add Null Checks to Project Form getFormData**: As a developer, I want getFormData to safely handle null values so that the application doesn't crash on missing form elements
