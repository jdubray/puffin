# Project Context

This file is auto-generated by Puffin to provide context to Claude Code.

## Project Overview

**Project:** puffin

Puffin is an Electron-based GUI application that serves as a **management layer** on top of the Claude Code CLI (3CLI). Its primary purpose is to:

1. **Track and organize** 3CLI outputs and conversations
2. **Provide context** to 3CLI through project configuration and history
3. **Visualize** the development process (prompts, responses, branches)
4. **Communicate UI designs** via the GUI designer

**Important**: 3CLI remains in control of building the project. Puffin is an orchestration and tracking tool, not a replacement for the CLI's capabilities.

## Coding Preferences

- **Programming Style:** Hybrid (OOP + FP)
- **Testing Approach:** Behavior-Driven Development
- **Documentation Level:** Standard
- **Error Handling:** Exceptions
- **Naming Convention:** camelCase
- **Comment Style:** JSDoc

## Active User Stories

### 📋 Multi-Hop Handoff Chaining

As a user, I want to chain multiple handoff summaries together so that context is preserved across multiple handoff sequences

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- When creating a new handoff from a thread that received a handoff, both summaries are linked
- Chained handoff summaries are presented in chronological order
- The receiving thread can access the full chain of handoff context
- User can view the complete handoff chain history
- Each hop in the chain is clearly identified with its source thread

### 📋 Stuck Detection Threshold

As a user, I want the system to detect when execution is stuck after 3 similar iterations so that I am alerted to potential issues

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- System tracks iteration outputs for similarity
- Alert is triggered after 3 consecutive similar iterations
- User is notified when stuck state is detected
- User can choose to continue, modify approach, or stop execution
- Stuck detection resets when output changes significantly
