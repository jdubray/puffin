# Project Context

This file is auto-generated by Puffin to provide context to Claude Code.

## Project Overview

**Project:** puffin

Puffin is an Electron-based GUI application that serves as a **management layer** on top of the Claude Code CLI (3CLI). Its primary purpose is to:

1. **Track and organize** 3CLI outputs and conversations
2. **Provide context** to 3CLI through project configuration and history
3. **Visualize** the development process (prompts, responses, branches)
4. **Communicate UI designs** via the GUI designer

**Important**: 3CLI remains in control of building the project. Puffin is an orchestration and tracking tool, not a replacement for the CLI's capabilities.

## File Access Restrictions

**IMPORTANT: You must ONLY access files within this project directory.**

You are NOT allowed to:
- Read, write, or modify files outside this project
- Access parent directories or sibling projects
- Reference or use files from other projects on the system
- Execute commands that affect files outside the project root

All file operations must be scoped to this project directory and its subdirectories.

## Coding Preferences

- **Programming Style:** Hybrid (OOP + FP)
- **Testing Approach:** Behavior-Driven Development
- **Documentation Level:** Standard
- **Error Handling:** Exceptions
- **Naming Convention:** camelCase
- **Comment Style:** JSDoc

## Branch Focus: Backend

You are working on the **backend thread**. Focus on:
- API design and implementation
- Data persistence and database operations
- Business logic and validation
- Error handling and logging
- Security and authentication

## Key Backend Files

| Purpose | Location |
|---------|----------|
| Main entry | `src/main/main.js` |
| IPC handlers | `src/main/ipc-handlers.js` |
| State management | `src/main/puffin-state.js` |
| Claude service | `src/main/claude-service.js` |
| Plugin loader | `src/main/plugin-loader.js` |

## IPC Handler Pattern

```javascript
ipcMain.handle('namespace:action', async (event, args) => {
  try {
    // Validate input
    // Perform operation
    return { success: true, data: result }
  } catch (error) {
    return { success: false, error: error.message }
  }
})
```
