# Puffin

A GUI for Claude Code to help cloders collaborate on new projects.

## Why Puffin?

Claude Code is extraordinary out of the box. It can take you to production for projects in the 10k-100k LoC range. But as projects grow, maintaining context, traceability, and structured collaboration becomes critical.

**Puffin helps you get there faster, in a more maintainable way, with full traceability.**

The key insight: prompts alone create confusion. Claude responds much better to a **backlog-driven workflow**:

1. **Prompts generate user stories** - Your specifications become structured, reviewable stories
2. **Stories live in a backlog** - A clear queue of work, not scattered across conversation threads
3. **Pull stories into implementation threads** - Focused context for each piece of work
4. **Mark complete when done** - Clear progress tracking and history

This history, captured outside of Claude's context window, lets you charge ahead and grow your project without losing track of what was built, why, and how.

## Overview

Puffin is an Electron-based application that provides a visual interface for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. Rather than replacing the terminal, Puffin wraps it—giving you full agentic capabilities (file read/write, bash execution, tool use) with a structured workflow for managing cloding projects.

**Puffin's philosophy** is to provide a hierarchical view of the tasks being performed by Claude with traceability to architecture and user stories so that it becomes easier to work collaboratively with Claude and other cloders, rather than just being a passive tester.

You can't "prompt along" a coding agent, just like you can't "prompt along" a developer—there are good reasons why we came up with processes and methodologies to build complex solutions. Processes and methodologies for cloding are yet to be built, but they are coming. Puffin serves as a foundation for structured collaboration between humans and AI coding agents.


**Key Features:**

- **Project Configuration**: Define your project's description, assumptions, technical architecture, and data model
- **Claude Guidance Options**: Set preferences for programming style (OOP, FP, Temporal Logic), testing approach, documentation level, and more
- **Branched Conversations**: Organize prompts into branches (Specifications, Architecture, UI, Backend, Deployment) with tree-based history navigation
- **Real-time Activity Tracking**: Monitor Claude's tool execution in real-time, showing current tools, file operations, and processing status
- **User Story Derivation Workflow**: Extract user stories from project specifications, review and refine them, then generate implementation prompts
- **GUI Designer**: Visual drag-and-drop interface for designing UI layouts that can be described to Claude
- **User Stories Management**: Full CRUD lifecycle for user stories with intelligent derivation from specifications using Claude
- **Architecture Document**: Living documentation that evolves with Claude reviews
- **Intelligent Title Generation**: Automatic prompt title generation using Claude API with smart fallback mechanisms
- **CLI Output View**: Real-time streaming of Claude's raw JSON output for debugging and transparency

## How It Works

Puffin opens a project directory (like VS Code) and stores its state in a `.puffin/` folder within that directory. When you submit a prompt, Puffin spawns the Claude Code CLI as a subprocess, streams the response in real-time, and persists the conversation history.

```
Your Project/
├── .puffin/
│   ├── config.json      # Project configuration & Claude options
│   ├── history.json     # Branched conversation history
│   └── architecture.md  # Architecture document
├── src/
└── ...your project files
```

## Technology Stack

- **Platform**: Electron 33+
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+ modules)
- **State Management**: SAM Pattern ([sam-pattern](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sam-pattern) + [sam-fsm](https://github.com/jdubray/sam-fsm))
- **AI Integration**: Claude Code CLI (spawned as subprocess with JSON streaming)
- **Markdown**: [marked](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked) for rendering responses

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Claude Code CLI installed globally: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- Active Claude Code subscription or API access

### Claude Authentication

Before using Puffin, you must authenticate Claude Code CLI in your terminal:

1. **Install Claude Code CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

2. **Authenticate Claude** in your terminal:
   ```bash
   claude auth
   ```
   This will open a browser window where you'll log in to your Claude account and authorize the CLI.

3. **Verify authentication**:
   ```bash
   claude --version
   ```
   You should see the version number without any authentication errors.

**Important**: The authentication happens at the system level through the Claude CLI. Once authenticated, Puffin will inherit this authentication when it spawns Claude as a subprocess. You don't need to re-authenticate within Puffin itself.

**For PowerShell users**: If you prefer to start Claude in PowerShell first and then run Puffin, you can:
```powershell
# Start Claude in the background (optional)
claude

# In the same or different PowerShell window
npm start
```
This approach ensures Claude is fully initialized before Puffin attempts to use it.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jdubray/puffin.git
cd puffin

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Verify Claude CLI is installed
claude --version

# Start the application
npm start
```

On launch, Puffin will prompt you to select a project directory. You can also pass a directory as an argument:

```bash
npm start /path/to/your/project
```

### Development

```bash
# Run with DevTools enabled
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Package for distribution
npm run package
```

```

## SAM Pattern Architecture

Puffin uses the SAM (State-Action-Model) pattern for predictable state management:

```
User Intent → Action → Model → State → View → User Intent...
```

Two FSMs control application flow:
- **App FSM**: Application lifecycle (uninitialized → initializing → ready → error)
- **Prompt FSM**: Prompt lifecycle (idle → composing → submitted → streaming → completed/error)

The SAM Debugger (toggle with the magnifying glass icon or Ctrl+Shift+D) provides real-time visibility into state transitions.

## Latest Features

### Backlog-Driven Workflow
The core of Puffin's approach to structured cloding:

```
Prompt → Derive Stories → Review → Backlog → Pull → Thread → Implement → Complete
```

- **Story Derivation**: Claude extracts user stories from your specifications
- **Review Interface**: Refine, edit, or discard proposed stories before committing
- **Backlog Management**: Stories queue up with status tracking (Pending → In Progress → Completed)
- **Implementation Threads**: Each story gets its own focused thread with full context
- **Completion Tracking**: Mark stories and threads complete for clear progress visibility

### Expandable Thread History
Navigate complex project histories with ease:
- **Collapsible Threads**: All threads start collapsed for a clean overview
- **Expand on Click**: Click to expand and see child prompts
- **Visual Indicators**: Arrows show expandable threads, checkmarks show completed ones
- **Context Menu**: Right-click to mark complete, expand/collapse, or reply
- **Strikethrough Styling**: Completed threads are visually distinct

### Real-time Activity Tracking
Enhanced transparency during prompt execution:
- **Tool Monitoring**: Real-time display of active Claude tools (Read, Write, Bash, etc.)
- **File Operations**: Track which files are being read, written, or edited
- **Status Indicators**: Visual feedback showing thinking, tool-use, and completion states
- **Concurrent Support**: Monitor multiple simultaneous tool executions

### Context Window Management
Keep Claude focused on what matters:
- **Visual Context Indicator**: See which prompts are in Claude's context window
- **Session Resumption**: Automatically resumes Claude sessions to maintain context
- **Smart History**: Only sends relevant context when resuming, not redundant history
