# Puffin

**Version 3.0 - Central Reasoning Engine Edition**

A structured development environment for Claude Code that transforms AI coding from conversation into deterministic, traceable software engineering.

> **🚀 New in v3.0:** Central Reasoning Engine (CRE), Excalidraw AI Diagrams, Memory Plugin, and automated sprint orchestration with Code Model tracking.



## Why Puffin?

Claude Code is extraordinary out of the box. It can take you to production for projects in the 10k-100k LoC range. But as projects grow, maintaining context, traceability, and structured collaboration becomes critical.

**Puffin transforms AI coding from ad-hoc prompting into structured software engineering.**

### The Key Insight

Prompts alone create confusion. Claude responds much better to a **backlog-driven workflow with implementation plans**:

1. **Prompts → User Stories** - Specifications become structured, reviewable stories
2. **Stories → Sprint Planning** - CRE generates implementation plans with dependencies and sequencing
3. **Plans → Ready-to-Implement Specs (RIS)** - Deterministic specifications that any AI could implement
4. **RIS → Implementation** - Claude executes with full architectural context from the Code Model
5. **Code Review → Verification** - Assertions validate correctness, findings tracked for bug fixes

This structured approach, with **automated Code Model maintenance**, ensures traceability from requirements through implementation. You can charge ahead on complex projects without losing track of what was built, why, and how.

### What Makes v3.0 Different

| Traditional AI Coding | Puffin v3.0 |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Ad-hoc prompts | Structured user stories → Plans → RIS |
| Context lost over time | Code Model tracks codebase structure |
| Repeat architecture context | Memory Plugin auto-injects knowledge |
| Manual story-by-story | Automated sprint orchestration |
| Text-only planning | AI-generated diagrams from docs |
| Hope code matches requirements | Inspection assertions verify correctness |
| Implementation details in prompts | CRE generates deterministic RIS specs |

**Key Benefits:**
- **Deterministic Implementation** - Same RIS produces equivalent results across runs
- **Traceability** - Track from requirements → plan → RIS → implementation → verification
- **Knowledge Retention** - Architectural decisions preserved and auto-applied
- **Sprint Automation** - Let Claude orchestrate entire implementation cycles
- **Visual Documentation** - Generate diagrams directly from markdown docs

## Overview

Puffin is an Electron-based application that provides a visual interface for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), Anthropic's official CLI for Claude. Rather than replacing the terminal, Puffin wraps it—giving you full agentic capabilities (file read/write, bash execution, tool use) with a structured workflow for managing cloding projects.

**Puffin's philosophy** is to provide a hierarchical view of the tasks being performed by Claude with traceability to architecture and user stories so that it becomes easier to work collaboratively with Claude and other cloders, rather than just being a passive tester.

You can't "prompt along" a coding agent, just like you can't "prompt along" a developer—there are good reasons why we came up with processes and methodologies to build complex solutions. Processes and methodologies for cloding are yet to be built, but they are coming. Puffin serves as a foundation for structured collaboration between humans and AI coding agents.

## Have Questions?

Ask in our [Q&A Discussions](https://github.com/jdubray/puffin/discussions/categories/q-a) and get AI-powered answers! Our bot uses Claude to respond to questions about Puffin, its features, and how to use it.

## How It Works

Puffin opens a project directory (like VS Code) and stores its state in a `.puffin/` folder within that directory. When you submit a prompt, Puffin spawns the Claude Code CLI as a subprocess, streams the response in real-time, and persists the conversation history.

```
Your Project/
├── .puffin/
│   ├── config.json      # Project configuration & Claude options
│   ├── history.json     # Branched conversation history
│   ├── puffin.db        # SQLite database (user stories, sprints, etc.)
│   ├── architecture.md  # Architecture document

## SAM Pattern Architecture

Puffin uses the SAM (State-Action-Model) pattern for predictable state management:

```
User Intent → Action → Model → State → View → User Intent...
```

Two FSMs control application flow:
- **App FSM**: Application lifecycle (uninitialized → initializing → ready → error)
- **Prompt FSM**: Prompt lifecycle (idle → composing → submitted → streaming → completed/error)

The SAM Debugger (toggle with the magnifying glass icon or Ctrl+Shift+D) provides real-time visibility into state transitions.

## 🎉 What's New in v3.0.0

### Central Reasoning Engine (CRE)
The CRE transforms Puffin from a conversation tracker into a deterministic implementation system:

- **Two-Stage Planning**: Plans specify sequence and dependencies, RIS provides execution details
- **Code Model (h-DSL)**: Living representation of your codebase structure
- **Inspection Assertions**: Testable criteria validate each implementation
- **Plan Iteration**: Review, question, and refine plans before approval
- **CRE Introspector**: Automatically updates Code Model after each sprint

**Workflow**: Sprint → CRE generates Plan → User approves → CRE generates RIS → Claude implements → Introspector updates Code Model

### Excalidraw AI Diagram Generation
Generate professional diagrams from your documentation:

- **Doc-to-Diagram Pipeline**: Select markdown file, choose diagram type, Claude generates elements
- **Diagram Types**: Architecture, sequence, flowchart, component diagrams
- **Hand-Drawn Aesthetic**: Professional yet approachable via Rough.js rendering
- **Export Formats**: PNG, SVG, JSON
- **Editable Results**: Generated diagrams are fully editable in Excalidraw

### Memory Plugin
Stop repeating context - let Puffin remember architectural decisions:

- **Auto-Extraction**: Background analysis extracts domain knowledge from conversations
- **Categorized Storage**: Facts, Architectural Decisions, Conventions, Bug Patterns
- **Auto-Injection**: Branch memory automatically included in CLAUDE.md context
- **Memory Evolution**: New knowledge merges with existing, deduplicates, resolves conflicts

### Code Model Plugin
Visualize and explore your Code Model:

- **Interactive Graph**: Navigate modules, dependencies, and relationships
- **Annotations**: See which primitives (TERM, PROSE, RELATION, etc.) map to each element
- **Dependency Tracing**: Follow import chains and call relationships

### Previous Releases

#### Inline Prompt Markers (v2.14.0)
Embed Claude instructions directly in your documents with the new marker syntax:

```
/@puffin: your instructions here @/
```

- **Insert via toolbar, context menu, or Ctrl+M**
- **Visual highlighting** with yellow background and 🐧 icon
- **Multiline support** for complex instructions
- **Holistic processing** - Claude sees all markers and applies changes cohesively
- **Clean markers button** removes all markers when you're done

This workflow lets you annotate your code exactly where changes are needed, making it easier to communicate precise modifications to Claude.

### Automated Sprint Implementation (v2.12.0)
Let Claude orchestrate entire sprints autonomously:

- **Implementation Mode Selection**: After plan approval, choose between automated (Claude orchestrates everything) or human-controlled (manual story-by-story)
- **Intelligent Story Ordering**: Claude analyzes dependencies and determines optimal implementation sequence
- **Branch Assignment**: Each story is assigned to the appropriate branch (UI, Backend, Fullstack, Plugin)
- **Orchestration Plan Review**: See the complete implementation plan before Claude starts
- **Sequential Sessions**: Each story is implemented in a separate, clean session
- **Acceptance Criteria Validation**: Automatic verification after each story implementation
- **Code Review Phase**: Automated code review identifies issues after all stories complete
- **Bug Fix Sessions**: Sequential sessions to address each finding from code review
- **Completion Statistics**: Summary showing costs, durations, and outcomes
- **Graceful Interruption**: Pause or stop automated implementation at any point

### Backlog-Driven Workflow
The core of Puffin's approach to structured cloding:

```
Prompt → Derive Stories → Review → Backlog → Pull → Thread → Implement → Complete
```

- **Story Derivation**: Claude extracts user stories from your specifications
- **Review Interface**: Refine, edit, or discard proposed stories before committing
- **Backlog Management**: Stories queue up with status tracking (Pending → In Progress → Completed)
- **Implementation Threads**: Each story gets its own focused thread with full context
- **Completion Tracking**: Mark stories and threads complete for clear progress visibility

### Expandable Thread History
Navigate complex project histories with ease:
- **Collapsible Threads**: All threads start collapsed for a clean overview
- **Expand on Click**: Click to expand and see child prompts
- **Visual Indicators**: Arrows show expandable threads, checkmarks show completed ones
- **Context Menu**: Right-click to mark complete, expand/collapse, or reply
- **Strikethrough Styling**: Completed threads are visually distinct

### Real-time Activity Tracking
Enhanced transparency during prompt execution:
- **Tool Monitoring**: Real-time display of active Claude tools (Read, Write, Bash, etc.)
- **File Operations**: Track which files are being read, written, or edited
- **Status Indicators**: Visual feedback showing thinking, tool-use, and completion states
- **Concurrent Support**: Monitor multiple simultaneous tool executions

### Context Window Management
Keep Claude focused on what matters:
- **Visual Context Indicator**: See which prompts are in Claude's context window
- **Session Resumption**: Automatically resumes Claude sessions to maintain context
- **Smart History**: Only sends relevant context when resuming, not redundant history

### Git Integration
Puffin includes a comprehensive Git panel for repository management directly within the application:
- **Branch Management**: Create, switch, and delete branches with configurable prefixes (feature/, bugfix/, etc.)
- **Change Staging**: View modified files, stage/unstage individual files or all changes
- **Commit Workflow**: Write commit messages manually or generate them with Claude based on staged changes
- **Merge Operations**: Merge branches with conflict detection and resolution guidance
- **Operation History**: Track all Git operations performed through Puffin

**Cross-Platform Line Endings**: Puffin includes a `.gitattributes` file that automatically normalizes line endings (CRLF/LF) across different operating systems. This prevents phantom "modified" files when working in mixed environments like Windows with WSL. No additional configuration is required—Git will automatically handle line ending conversions on commit.
