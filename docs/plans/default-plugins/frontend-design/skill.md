# Frontend Design Skill

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality.

## Purpose

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. It emphasizes implementing real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a **BOLD aesthetic direction**:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?

2. **Tone**: Pick an extreme aesthetic direction:
   - Brutally minimal
   - Maximalist chaos
   - Retro-futuristic
   - Organic/natural
   - Luxury/refined
   - Playful/toy-like
   - Editorial/magazine
   - Brutalist/raw
   - Art deco/geometric
   - Soft/pastel
   - Industrial/utilitarian

3. **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)

4. **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

### Critical Principle

Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with **precision**. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is **intentionality, not intensity**.

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography
- Choose fonts that are **beautiful, unique, and interesting**
- Avoid generic fonts (Arial, Inter)
- Pair a distinctive **display font** with a refined **body font**

### Color & Theme
- Commit to a **cohesive aesthetic**
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- **Dominant colors with sharp accents** outperform timid palettes

### Motion
- Use animations for **effects and micro-interactions**
- Focus on **high-impact moments**: one well-orchestrated page load creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions
- Use **scroll-triggering and hover states** that surprise

### Spatial Composition
- **Unexpected layouts**
- **Asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow**
- **Grid-breaking elements**
- **Generous negative space** OR **controlled density**

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
- Create **atmosphere and depth** rather than solid colors
- Apply creative forms: gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders

## What to NEVER Do

**Generic AI-generated aesthetics** include:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character

## Key Instructions

1. Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices
2. No design should be the same — vary themes, fonts, aesthetics
3. NEVER converge on common choices across generations
4. Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision
